The CNK Game Engine in Java

Welcome you have reached the Github for our CNK Game Engine. Just four friends who wanted learn about software development and the adventures of working together to create software.

This is an early build of our game engine. It has a good deal of functionality, you can add GUI's, custom AI actions, custom key bindings, and lots of other cool stuff. The design philosophy we had approaching this was for the budding student, like ourselves, who wanted to learn about game design and Java from a top down approach.

The engine is written in Java using Java's Swing libraries for rendering. We felt like this was the best way to go, as anyone who wanted to work on the project or run the games, needed only the basic Java JRE. We started with a layered approach and tried to design a system that was extensible, easy to use, and at the end of the day could make games. All of this before we learned about design patterns! :P
